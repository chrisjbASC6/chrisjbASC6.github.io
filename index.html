        <div id="aboutme">
            <div>Born on November 3rd, 2003, a goat was born. I was raised to never back down from anyone and stand my ground. My parents are both native to Haiti. The first rap song I listened to was "Fight Night by Migos. Ever since I was a kid, my friends and family looked to me to help them with any troubleshoot problems. When I was a kid I was strangly addicted to the game roblox. As the years progressed, I changed and matured, started to make my own purchases and flow with my own wave. I forever love my mom and my main goal in life is to be able to pay my mo back. When I can sucessfuly wire $50,000 of my own money to my mom's bank account, I will finally feel a sense of achivement.</div>
